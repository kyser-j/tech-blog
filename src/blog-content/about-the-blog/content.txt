Sup guys. Anyone else tired of the half-assed coding blogs doing the bare minimum to get a weird looking Microsoft badge? Same. This isn’t going to be your `paste code here without description` blog. No, we’re going to be building real applications in public. Why? Because I’ve obviously got nothing better to do with my time at the moment.

Here’s how it’s going to work. I’m going to choose a project that sounds fun, and then build it. All the juicy deets will be created as blog posts (juicy deets = real helpful information, not the *then run* ` npx create-next-app@latest` *to get your project started*. Sorry, but if you can’t read documentation to figure that part out this blog probably isn’t going to be for you.

Who is this blog is for:
- mid/senior level devs looking for something interesting or a learning opportunity
- people who are interested in how different kinds of software applications are built
- nerds

Who is this blog NOT for:
- idk

*Googles: how to make a python variable* **You should probably look somewhere else** \
*Reads Martin Fowler bedtime stories to their kids* **No one is ACTUALLY this good at development, you’re probably in the wrong place**

Jokes aside, this blog is being built as a resource for developers to come to and learn/get some ideas from. I’m not perfect at development, but I want to share what I’ve learned to see if it helps others out. I’d love to have comments on what I could do better when building this stuff and learn from the masses as well!

P.S. Everything I build for this blog will be open-source and available on GitHub \- including this blog.

Thanks for sticking around!
